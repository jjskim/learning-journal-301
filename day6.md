# Learning Journal Code 301 - Day 6

Today's lab was a pretty short one and was a nice refresher on using localStorage to both store and retrieve data. Learning about Ajax has to be my favorite part of the course so far -- I think it's really interesting that it allows the rest of the page to continue to be usable while a response is waited on from the server. After today's class, I realized how many pages and applications on the web use Ajax to improve usability and function, without me even knowing it. I'm eager to learn more about Ajax and the backend in the coming days.
