# Learning Journal Code 301 - Day 15

We finally got our project groups and I found out the instructional staff put me in a group of 3 again. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little upset, but there's nothing that can be done about it now. Anyways, the project we've all decided on is using the PokeAPI to create a sort of Pokedex app. I'm not completely sure how we're going to build it at the moment, but I'm eager to start testing and building it out over the weekend. Compared to 201, I don't feel like I have a very strong mastery on a lot of the topics, but we'll see how the next week goes.
