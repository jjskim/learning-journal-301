# Learning Journal Code 301 - Day 11

On Monday we learned about client-side routing and how we are able to bypass sending a request to the server when the URL is changed, and instead have the URL change handled completely in the view layer. This is the first step in making single page web applications and I'm interested to see what other changes we will learn this week.
