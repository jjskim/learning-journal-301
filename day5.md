# Learning Journal Code 301 - Day 5

Friday was a hectic day. The lecture portion of class was cut short, and we were sort of "forced" to watch the 401 mid-way presentations by Brandy, and then again at 1:00 so I didn't really get started on my lab until 3:00. I found out later through my classmates that the lab for today was supposed to be more of a in-class demo with Sam, so Zach, Han, and I started watching the videos at 2x speed trying to finish the lab before we went home. Overall, Friday was just a hot-mess. What a day.
