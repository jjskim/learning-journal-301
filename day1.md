# Learning Journal Code 301 - Day 1

Today was the first day of 301 and most of it was spent going over the structure of the course, as well as introducing briefly the topics we will be learning later on. For our first lab, we worked on modifying a webpage to use responsive design. It went okay, but I can definitely admit that I am rusty with CSS. Still, I think the whole idea of making webpages that are scalable and responsive to different screens and devices is really interesting and I'm looking forward to learning more in the coming days.
